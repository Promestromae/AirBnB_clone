# AirBnB_clone
# Creation of a command interpreter to manage the hbnb projects


Background Context
Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!

# Description of the project

This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. The aim of the project is to deploy a replica of the Airbnb Website using my server. The final version of this project will have:

. A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like a shell (for development and debugging)
. A website (front-end) with static and dynamic functionalities
. A comprehensive database to manage the backend functionalities
. An API that provides a communication interface between the front and backend of the system.
# Resources

# Aims & Objectives of this project
This will help to be able to manage the objects of our project:

. Creation of a new object (ex: a new "User" or a new "Place")
. Retrieval of an object from a file storage, a database etc… 
. Perform operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
. Update attributes of an object
. Destroy an object

# The created objects
The list of the objects (instances) that can be created are as follows:

.BaseModel
.User
.City
.Amenity
.State
.Review
.Place
# Files and Directories
.models directory contains all classes used for the entire project. A class, called “model” in a OOP project is the representation of an object/instance.
.tests directory contains all unit tests.
.console.py file is the entry point of our command interpreter.
.models/base_model.py file is the base class of all our models. It contains common elements:
   attributes: id, created_at and updated_at
   methods: save() and to_json()
.models/engine directory contains all storage classes (using the same prototype). For the moment I will have only one: file_storage.py.
The project's implementation will happen in the following phases:

# Phase One
The first phase is to manipulate a powerful storage system to give an abstraction between objects and how they are stored and persisted. To achieve this, I will:

.put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of my future instances
.create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
.create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
.create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
.create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
.Create a data model
.Manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console/command interpreter
.Store and persist objects to files (JSON files)
# Commands Implemented
Description of the command interpreter

 Commands	Description
quit 	:This command quits or exits the console
EOF	:This command quits or exits the console interpreter when pressed Ctrl+D
help or help <command>	:Displays all commands or Displays instructions for a specific command (Ex: help or help quit).
create <class>	:Creates an object of type, saves it to a JSON file, and prints the objects ID (Ex: create BaseModel or BaseModel.create())
show <class> <ID>	:Shows string representation of an object (Ex: show BaseModel 1234-1234-1234 or BaseModel.show("1234-1234-1234"))
destroy <class> <ID>	:Deletes an objects based on the class name and id (Ex: destroy BaseModel 1234-1234-1234 or BaseModel.destroy("1234-1234-1234")).
all or all <class>	:Prints all string representations of all objects or Prints all string representations of all objects of a specific class (Ex: all BaseModel or all or User.all()).
update <class> <id> <attribute name> "<attribute value>"	:Updates an object with a certain attribute (new or existing) (Usage: update <class name> <id> <attribute name> "<attribute value>).
<class>.all()	:Same as all <class>
<class>.count()	:Retrieves the number of objects of a certain class (Usage: <class name>.count(), Example: User.count()).
<class>.show(<ID>)	:Same as show <class> <ID>
<class>.destroy(<ID>)	:Same as destroy <class> <ID>
<class>.update(<ID>, <attribute name>, <attribute value>	:Same as update <class> <ID> <attribute name> <attribute value>
<class>.update(<ID>, <dictionary representation>)	:Updates an objects based on a dictionary representation of attribute names and values
# Compilation
To start up the interpreter, clone this repository, and run the console file on linux as follows:

Clone this repository: git clone "https://github.com/Promestromae/AirBnB_clone.git"
Access AirBnb directory: cd AirBnB_clone
Run hbnb(interactively): ./console and then press enter command
Run hbnb(non-interactively): echo "<command>" | ./console.py
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
But also in non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C)

$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)
